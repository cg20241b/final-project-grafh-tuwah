# Simple TCG Simulator - Visual Focused

This project is a simplified Trading Card Game (TCG) simulator built in Unity, focusing on card asset visuals and basic player interaction. The goal is to showcase card animations, shaders, and textures in a visually appealing and interactive way, while minimizing complex game logic.

## Project Overview

This version of the TCG Simulator focuses on the visual aspects of card interactions. Instead of implementing full turn-based mechanics, we focus on building beautiful and dynamic card visuals, using Unity's shader, texture, and UI rendering capabilities. The game will allow users to drag and drop cards, flip them, and interact with them visually.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop card interactions.
- Card flipping animation (front and back view).
- Dynamic card visuals with glow, hover, and selection effects.
- Background and card visual effects using shaders.

## Technical Concepts

1. **Shaders**: Shaders are heavily used to create dynamic effects when cards are selected or moved. This includes glowing borders and special effects like pulsing animations.

2. **Textures**: Custom textures will be applied to both the front and back of each card. This allows each card to have its own unique artwork.

3. **Transformations**: Cards can be flipped and zoomed in/out when interacted with. Transformations such as scaling and rotating will be used to animate these actions smoothly.
